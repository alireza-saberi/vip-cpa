    According to the Canada Revenue Agency, all resident corporations (except crown corporations and resident charities)
    have to file a corporate income tax (T2) return every tax year even if there is no tax payable.
    This includes but is not limited to the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-profit organizations</li>
    <li>Tax-exempt corporations</li>
    <li>Inactive corporations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As your corporate tax accountant in Montreal, VIP CPA will ensure that you file your return no later than six months
    after the end of each tax year. The tax year of a corporation is its fiscal period. When the corporationâ€™s tax year
    ends on the last day of the month, returns should be filed by the last day of the sixth month after the end of the
    tax year. When the last day of the tax year is not the last day of the month, file the return by the same day of
    the sixth month after the end of the tax year. Please keep in mind that even though the filing date of the return
    is six months after the end of the tax year, if any amount of money is owed in the form of corporate income tax
    then tax payments must be made no later than three months (90 days) after the end of the tax year.
    For example, if your fiscal year-end is December 31, XXXX. The corporate return would have to be filed by June 30,
    XXX but any taxes owed must be paid by March 31, XXXX. Any payments that are received late will be subject to
    interest and penalties by the CRA.
