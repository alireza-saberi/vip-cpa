  <h2>
    How do I tell if I need business financial statements?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Often the need for business financial statements is driven by the need to file tax returns
    (personal, corporate and trust), minimize, plan and determine tax liabilities and support business decisions.
    Most sets of <strong>business financial statements in Montreal </strong> of owner-managed enterprises are prepared
    for one or more of three groups of users: managers, owners, and banks or other creditors.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many jurisdictions business financial statements, income statements and balance sheets are
    required by law for most corporations. Please review the requirements of your corporation based
    on the jurisdiction in which your business is incorporated.

    Determining the appropriate level of reporting
  </h3>
  <p>
    Our professionals at the firm determine the appropriate level of reporting by gathering extensive
    information about your company, its operating environment, and its strengths and weaknesses.
    In addition to identifying the client’s needs, it is also necessary to identify the needs of other users of
    the financial statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Audit Engagement Report </em> – provides the highest level of assurance on financial statements of a business.
    It is a methodical review and objective examination of the <strong>business financial statements in Montreal</strong>.
    The work that is required during an audit is reviewing internal controls, testing selected transactions and
    communicating with third parties. Based on findings, the chartered accountant firm issues a report on whether
    the business financial statements are fairly stated and free of material misstatements.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Review Engagement Report </em>– provides a moderate level of assurance (and provides no opinion) on <strong>business
    financial statements in Montreal</strong>. Our Chartered Accountants at the firm gather sufficient evidence and
    perform sufficient procedures upon which to form a negative form of communication regarding whether the information
    being assured is fairly presented.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Notice to Readers </em>– business financial statements prepared without audit or review.
    As Chartered Accountants in Montreal, we compile <strong>business financial statements </strong>for clients and
    present information that is a “representation of management” and expresses no opinion or assurance on the statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, banks and other creditors usually want audited or reviewed <strong>business financial statements </strong>
    in Montreal as part of their lending covenants.
